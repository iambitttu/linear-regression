Linear regression is a widely used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the differences between the observed and predicted values.

While I can provide you with a general overview of linear regression, keep in mind that the specific implementation and documentation may vary depending on the programming language or software library you are using. Here's a high-level description of the key concepts and steps involved in linear regression:

1. Model Representation:
   Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable (often denoted as 'y') and one or more independent variables (often denoted as 'x'). The model representation can be written as:
   y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn

   Here, b0 is the intercept (the value of y when all the independent variables are zero), b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients (also called regression weights) that represent the impact of each independent variable, and x1, x2, ..., xn are the values of the independent variables.

2. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):
   The most common method used to estimate the regression coefficients is called Ordinary Least Squares. It minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.

3. Assumptions of Linear Regression:
   Linear regression relies on several assumptions, including linearity, independence, homoscedasticity (constant variance), and absence of multicollinearity (no strong correlations between independent variables).

4. Data Preparation:
   Before applying linear regression, it is important to preprocess and prepare the data. This may involve handling missing values, scaling or normalizing the variables, dealing with outliers, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

5. Model Training:
   To train a linear regression model, you need a dataset with known values of the dependent variable and corresponding values of the independent variables. The model will estimate the regression coefficients based on this training data.

6. Model Evaluation:
   Once the model is trained, it is essential to assess its performance and generalization to unseen data. Common evaluation metrics for linear regression include mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

7. Prediction:
   After evaluating the model, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data by plugging in the values of the independent variables into the regression equation.
